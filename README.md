# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

A machine learning web app built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn** to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on:

- 📚 Hours Studied  
- 📅 Attendance Percentage  
- 🧪 Internal Marks  

> ⚡ Trained on a sample dataset and styled with custom CSS

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The app uses a **Logistic Regression model** trained on sample student performance data.
- The user enters:
  - Number of hours studied
  - Attendance %
  - Internal test marks
- The model predicts **Pass / Fail** with a themed UI.

> The final app features a **vintage paper texture**, serif fonts, and a soft color palette to give a calm, old-school academic vibe 🕰️
